The analysis : 

This visualisation is a scatter plot showing the spread of Total Fertility Rates values by regions of the world in 2018. 
The Total Fertility Rate scale ranges between 1 and 7 children per woman and each region is labelled with a specific colour on the right side of the scatter plot.

Our aim is to compare the African Total Fertility Rate to the rest of the world in order to justify our will to focus on the African continent. 
In fact,  we can clearly see that Sub-Saharan Africa’s countries Total Fertility Rate is mainly located between 4 and 6 whereas the other regions’ TFR is below 5 (except for three values). 
We can therefore conclude that Sub-Saharan Africa and thus the major part of the African continent, holds the highest Total Fertility Rate at world scale in 2018. 
This is partly why Africa is the first continent to be concerned with the challenge of population growth.
