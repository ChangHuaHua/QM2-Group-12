# Single and Multivariable Linear Regressions

The overall single linear regression results are outlined in this table:
| Independent variable            | Coefficient | R-squared     |
| :---                            |    :----:   |          ---: |
| HDI                             | -9.46       | 0.715         |
| Female education                | -0.108      | 0.401         |
| Female labor-force participation| 0.0263	    | 0.139         |
| Income (GNI per capita          | -0.0006     | 0.487         |


1. HDI vs TFR

From the scatterplot showing the relationship between HDI and TFR in African countries, there seems to be a clear negative correlation where as HDI decreases TFR decreases as well. 

The linear regression line has a slope of -9.46. This model predicts that for an increase in HDI of 1, the TFR decreases by 9.46. As the HDI is an index that ranges from 0 to 1, this coefficient can more effectively be interpreted at a smaller scale. This means that for an increase of HDI by 0.1 the TFR decreases by 0.946. The R-squared value of 0.715 suggests a moderately strong relationship between TFR and the development level of a country. This value can be interpreted to mean that 71.5% of the variation in TFR can be explained by the development level of a country in Africa. The p-value from the model is zero and below the significance level of 0.05. This means the relationship observed is statistically significant.

2. Female education vs TFR

This scatterplot also exhibits a moderately negative correlation, where as female participation in secondary education increases, TFR generally decreases. The model has a coefficient of -0.108, meaning that for a 1% increase in female secondary-education participation, the TFR decreases by about 0.108. The R-squared value of 0.401 indicates a moderate linear relationship between TFR and female education levels, with about 40.1% of the variation in TFR able to explained by the female participation in secondary education. The p-value from the model is zero and below the significance level of 0.05, hence the relationship observed is statistically significant.

3. Female labor-force participation vs TFR

The scatter plot showing the relationship between female labour-force participation and TFR is slightly more difficult to interpret. The regression model predicts a positive correlation between these variables, with a coefficient of 0.0263 and an R-squared value of 0.139. The R-squared is quite low, indicates a very weak correlation between these variables. 

While the single linear regression interprets and finds a positive correlation between these variables, looking deeper at the data reveals different trends. Some countries such as Mali and Benin exhibit a negative correlation between TFR and female labor-force participation, while others show positive correlations such as Burundi and Burkina Faso. These observations fuel our decision to create further visualisations that explore the relationship between TFR and female-labor force participation rate. 

4. Income (GNI per capita) vs TFR

This scatterplot suggests a negative correlation. The model predicts the income coefficient to be -0.0006 and an R-squared value of 0.487, indicates a moderate linear relationship between TFR and GNI per capita. The negative coefficient predicts that for a $1 increase in GNI per capita, the TFR would decrease by 0.0006. The p-value from the model is zero and below the significance level of 0.05. This means the relationship observed is statistically significant.


5. Multivariable linear regression

| Independent variable            | Coefficient | R-squared     |
| :---                            |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Female education                | -0.0861     | 0.639         |
| Income (GNI per capita          | -0.0005     |  -            |

In order to improve our models and understand the combined-effects of these variables we ran a multivariable linear regression model. Originally, all variables were planned to be included. However, because HDI is a composite index inherently encompassing indicators related to education and income it was omitted. Female labor-force participation rate was also omitted because of its extremely weak linear relationship exhibited in the single-linear regression and because it exhibited multicollinearity with female education. Hence, our final multi-regression model explored the influence of income and female education on TFR, with the results outlined below. 

The higher R-squared value of this model compared to the individual R-squared of each of the variables explored, means that looking at the combined influences of these variables can more better explains changes in TFR. An R-squared of 0.639 suggests a moderate relationship between these variables. The coefficient of both variables are negative, indicating that they possess a negative relationship with TFR. All other variables kept equal, a 1% increase in female education rates is predicted to decrease TFR by 0.0861, and a $1 increase in national income is predicted to decrease TFR by 0.0005. 


# World TFR Histogram 
Shape: Using 2018 data, the distribution of World TFR is skewed right, as the histogram’s tail is on the right-hand side. There is a concentration of data among countries with lower total fertility rates. The vast majority of countries in the world record lower total fertility rates (1-3), while decreasing numbers of countries record higher total fertility rates (4-7).

Center: The data seems to be centred around a total fertility rate of 1.8 children, implying that roughly half of the countries in the world have total fertility rates of 1.8 children. 

Spread: The data range is from 1 to about 7, so the approximate range equals 7-1 = 6 children.

Outliers: There doesn’t seem to be any obvious outliers.


# Africa TFR Histogram 
Shape: Using 2018 data, the distribution of TFR in Africa is fairly symmetric, as both tails of the histogram are approximately the same length. The data is concentrated among African countries with total fertility rates of 4-5 children, which is approximately in the middle of the range. 

Center: The center of the distribution is easily located, equating to a single mode of 4.6 children. This indicates that most African countries record total fertility rates of about 4.6 children.

Spread: The data range is from about 1.5 to 7, so the approximate range equals 7-1.5 = 5.5 children.

Outliers: There are 2 possible outliers to the far left (1.5) and far right (6.8) of the histogram, which also represent both ends of the data range.


Therefore, on average, most countries in the world have lower total fertility rates compared to those on the African continent.  

# 2D Density Contour Map (LFPR vs. TFR)

Scatterplot https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~uclqsdh/14/#/

Total Fertility Rate (TFR) and Female Labour Force Participation Rate (% of females aged 15 and above) (LFPR) data for countries in Africa was used. The earliest recorded data is from around 1990 and the latest recorded data is from around 2017. In the scatterplot, TFR (y-axis) is plotted against LFPR (x-axis) and each African country is represented by a series of dots which show how its TFR and LFPR have changed relative to each other over a period of time. For all African countries, it appears that as time progresses, TFR decreases. This can be seen from the yellow/lighter dots (indicating recent years) being plotted lower down on the y-axis. Longer dot lines indicate larger changes in TFR and the largest decreases in TFR are by about 3 children. The results are more mixed for LFPR, with only some African countries increasing LFPR rates as time progresses, while most have seen little if not no change at all. Visually, this is shown from the dot lines (from darker to lighter dots) for each country skewing right if LFPR has increased, left if LFPR decreased or remaining fairly straight if there has been little change in LFPR. The data suggests that African countries have shown significant development through the general fall in TFR rates, suggesting population growth at a more sustainable rate now than ever before. However, there is still much potential for gender equality by means of greater female participation in the labour force.


A 2D density contour map was then derived from the scatterplot. 

The values on the density contour map ranging from 5 to 55 are indicative of the number of dots from the scatterplot that were plotted in a particular area of the graph. As seen from areas on the map with the highest density (values of 40-55/highlighted in yellow), most of the data was plotted in regions where LFPR is 63-85% and TFR is 4.5-6.5 children. The high TFR and LFPR levels paint a rather different picture compared to the general TFR and LFPR trends of all African countries analysed from the scatter plot earlier. However, this is the result of child labour that has been exercised more frequently in African countries such as Rwanda, Malawai, Burkina Faso etc. that make up most of the dot plots in the highest density region and also have lower HDI.

# Scatter plot comparing TFR by regions of the world in 2018 

Scatter plot : https://plotly.com/~uclqsdh/23/ 

This visualisation, which is a scatter plot showing the spread of total fertility rates by regions of the world in 2018, was created using the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) dataset. The total fertility rate scale ranges between 1 and 7 children per woman and each region is labelled with a specific colour on the right side of the scatter plot.

Our aim is to compare the African total fertility rate to the rest of the world in order to justify our will to focus on the African continent. In fact,  we can clearly see that Sub-Saharan Africa’s countries total fertility rates represented by green dots, are mainly located between 4 and 6 whereas the other regions’ fertility rates are below 5 (except for three countries). We can therefore conclude that Sub-Saharan Africa and thus the major part of the African continent, holds the highest total fertility rate at world scale in 2018. This is partly why Africa is the first continent to be concerned with the challenge of population growth. 


# Choropleth Maps of Africa 

1960 map : file:///Users/User/Desktop/UCL/Year%202/QM2/Project/Python%20analysis/TFR_Choropleth_1960.html 
2018 map : file:///Users/User/Desktop/UCL/Year%202/QM2/Project/Python%20analysis/TFR_Choropleth_2018.html 

These two maps are choropleth maps of Africa giving total fertility rates in each country according to the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) dataset. Fertility rates (from 1 to 8) are represented by a color gradient ranging from yellow for low rates (around 2) to red for high rates (above 6). The first map dates back to 1960 and the second one to 2018. 

Following the 1960 map we see that, globally, every country are colored in orange/red meaning that each woman, in these countries, has between 5 and 8 children in average. When looking into more details at the map, we can notice light nuances. Few central countries such as Gabon, Central African Republic or Congo are orange which indicates that they hold a fertility rate inferior to 6 whereas the rest of the continent exceeds the number of 6 children per woman. 
The 2018 map illustrates an interesting evolution compared to the situation in 1960. Unlike 60 years ago, clear regional fragmentations are observable. Generally speaking, the North and the South are in yellow whereas Sub-Saharan countries are in orange. This suggests that low fertility rates (between 2 and 4) are located in the North and in the South and that high fertility rates are found in the Sub-Saharan region. It can be pointed out though that no woman has more than 6 children in these Sub-Saharan countries while this was the minimum rate in 1960. Nigeria remains the only country, however, where women have approximatively 7 children in their child bearing years. 
This decline in fertility rates which lead to a regional fragmentation can be explained by different factors which will be studied along the project.
