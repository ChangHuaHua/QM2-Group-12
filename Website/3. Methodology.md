# Methodology Part 1  (due WEEK 9)

* nature/sources of data, problems with data 

The data that we have used for this project come from a wide range of reputable sources. Our core data set is TFR data from the World Bank. This data set provides the TFR for each country from the years 1960 to 2018. In addition to this core data set we used three complementary data sets from a range of sources which apply to the various variables that we would like to explore in relation to TFR. We found female education data from the UN dataset. This data set provides the percentage of females in secondary education by country from 1975 to 2015. We will be using this variable as an indicator of the level of female education within a given country. The second data set pertains to the female labor force participation rate and found from Our World in Data. This data set provides the percentage of females participating in the labor force aged above 15 in each country. Lastly, from the UN Development Program we obtained data relating to the relative degree of development of a country. This is measured by the Human Development Index (HDI) and is given for each country from 1990 to 2018. 

Before beginning our analysis it was necessary to clean the data. This involved x, y, and z. 
Some problems we encountered while cleaning our data and making it usable for further analysis were ....
