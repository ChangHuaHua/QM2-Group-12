**The Data Sets**

The data that we have used for this project come from a wide range of reputable sources. Our core data set is TFR data from the World Bank. This data set provides the TFR for each country from the years 1960 to 2018. The zipfile from this source also included an additional data file with a table that maps each country based on its country code to the respective geographical region of the country *(ex: North America, South Asia, etc)*. Furthermore, the additional data file also indicated the income-level of each country described ordinally in 4 categories *(low income, lower middle income, upper middle income, high income)*.

Besides this core data set we used three complementary data sets from a range of sources which apply to the various variables that we would like to explore in relation to TFR. These data sets are outlined below: 
* 1. Female education data was found from the UN dataset. This dataset provides the percentage of females in secondary education by country from 1975 to 2015. We will be using this variable as an indicator of the level of female education within a given country.
* 2. The second data set pertains to the female labor force participation rate and found from Our World in Data. This data set provides the percentage of females over 15 years of age participating in the labor force in each country.
* 3. Lastly, from the UN Development Program we obtained data relating to the relative degree of development of a country. This is measured by the Human Development Index (HDI) and is given for each country from 1990 to 2018. 

All of our data was downloaded as comma-separated values (CSV) files to aid data manipulation in Python. 

**Cleaning the Data**

Before beginning our analysis it was necessary to clean the data. This involved dropping  empty columns that lacked data and removing fields unnecessary for our analysis. For example, our analysis was interested in country based analysis of TFR, but the TFR dataset had regional data as well (ex: providing the average TFR for South Asia). Hence we had to omit these rows. 

**Merging the Data**
