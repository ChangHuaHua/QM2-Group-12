Aims:
1. Track TFR in Africa over time and investigate how our chosen variables (Female Labour Force Participation Rate, the Human Development Index and Females' enrolment in Secondary Education) influence TFR and thus the estimation of population growth in this continent compared to the rest of the world. 
2. Draw conclusions to better inform government policies regarding population growth goals.


Objectives
1. Understand how Africa TFR rates compare to world TFR rates over time.
2. Determine whether there are any correlations, contrasts, discrepancies or outliers between our chosen variables (HDI, Girlâ€™s Education,  Female Labor Participation and Income) and TFR in order to pin down the more influencial variable(s) with regards to population growth in Africa.
3. Understand the geographical distribution of TFR in Africa to explore geographical trends on the continent.
4. Assess how newfound data relationships could better inform government policy on controlling TFR.
