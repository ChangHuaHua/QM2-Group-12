# Single and Multivariable Linear Regressions
1. HDI vs TFR


From the scatterplot showing the relationship between HDI and TFR in African countries, there seems to be a clear negative correlation where as HDI decreases TFR decreases as well. The results of the linear regression model run through statsmodels are shown below.  

The linear regression line has a  slope of -9.44. This model predicts that for an increase in HDI of 1, the TFR decreases by 9.44. As the HDI is an index that ranges from 0 to 1, this coefficient can more effectively be interpreted at a smaller scale. This means that for an increase of HDI by 0.1 the TFR decreases by 0.944. The R-squared value of 0.720 suggests a moderately strong relationship between TFR and the development level of a country. This value can be interpretted to mean that 72% of the variation in HDI can be explained by the development level of a country in Africa. The p-value from the model is zero and below the signifiance level of 0.05. This means the relationship observed is statistically significant. 


#. Multivariable linear regression

The table below outlines the results of the multivariable linear regression that was run using the independent variables of female secondary education and income.
