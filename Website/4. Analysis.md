# Single and Multivariable Linear Regressions
1. HDI vs TFR


From the scatterplot showing the relationship between HDI and TFR in African countries, there seems to be a clear negative correlation where as HDI decreases TFR decreases as well. The results of the linear regression model run through statsmodels are shown below.  

The linear regression line has a  slope of -9.44. This model predicts that for an increase in HDI of 1, the TFR decreases by 9.44. As the HDI is an index that ranges from 0 to 1, this coefficient can more effectively be interpreted at a smaller scale. This means that for an increase of HDI by 0.1 the TFR decreases by 0.944. The R-squared value of 0.720 suggests a moderately strong relationship between TFR and the development level of a country. This value can be interpretted to mean that 72% of the variation in HDI can be explained by the development level of a country in Africa. The p-value from the model is zero and below the signifiance level of 0.05. This means the relationship observed is statistically significant. 


#. Multivariable linear regression

The table below outlines the results of the multivariable linear regression that was run using the independent variables of female secondary education and income.

# World TFR Histogram 
Shape: Using 2018 data, the distribution of World TFR is skewed right, as the histogram’s tail is on the right-hand side. There is a concentration of data among countries with lower total fertility rates. The vast majority of countries in the world record lower total fertility rates (1-3), while decreasing numbers of countries record higher total fertility rates (4-7).

Center: The data seems to be centred around a total fertility rate of 1.8 children, implying that roughly half of the countries in the world have total fertility rates of 1.8 children. 

Spread: The data range is from 1 to about 7, so the approximate range equals 7-1 = 6 children.

Outliers: There doesn’t seem to be any obvious outliers.


# Africa TFR Histogram 
Shape: Using 2018 data, the distribution of TFR in Africa is fairly symmetric, as both tails of the histogram are approximately the same length. The data is concentrated among African countries with total fertility rates of 4-5 children, which is approximately in the middle of the range. 

Center: The center of the distribution is easily located, equating to a single mode of 4.6 children. This indicates that most African countries record total fertility rates of about 4.6 children.

Spread: The data range is from about 1.5 to 7, so the approximate range equals 7-1.5 = 5.5 children.

Outliers: There are 2 possible outliers to the far left (1.5) and far right (6.8) of the histogram, which also represent both ends of the data range.


Therefore, on average, most countries in the world have lower total fertility rates compared to those on the African continent.
