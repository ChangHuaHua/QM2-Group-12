Hello! My name is Shagun and I’m from India but have been living in Malaysia for most of my life. I am currently a second-year BASc student majoring in Health and Environment and minoring in Societies. My academic and personal interests lie in public health and I'm enjoying my current modules related to epidemiology, infection, immunology and economics. I’m particularly passionate about addressing challenges in the health sector to improve overall health and move towards universal health coverage.

Overall, I seek to use my skills to make positive difference in the world!
