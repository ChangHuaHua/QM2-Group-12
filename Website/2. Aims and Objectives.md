Aims:
1. Track TFR in Africa overtime and investigate how our chosen variables (Female Labour Force Participation Rate, the Human Development Index and Females' enrolment in Secondary Education) influence TFR and thus population growth's estimation in this continent in comparison to the rest of the world. 
2. Draw conclusions to better inform government policies regarding population growth goals.


Objectives
1. Analyse nation-wide statistics in Africa, specifically focusing on Total Fertility Rates (TFR) and explore geographical trends on the continent.
2. Determine whether there are any correlations, contrasts, discrepancies or outliers between our chosen variables (HDI, Girl’s Education,  Female Labor Participation and Income) and TFR in order to pin down the more influencial variable(s) with regards to population growth in Africa.
3. Create a line plot using Python to compare TFR's evolution across time at african and global scale in order to verify that Africa's TFR is above the world's mean. 
4. Create a histogram showing distribution of TFR Rates and a comparison of TFR in Africa and the world.
5. Create a Heatmap comparing, analysing ...
6. Multivariable regression ....
7. Create a scatterplot ...
8. Design a graph that compares the world's least and most developed countries LPFR and TFR in order to evaluate HDI's influence on this relationship. 
9. Finally, investigate how newfound data relationships could better inform government policy on population growth to aid overall economic and human development
