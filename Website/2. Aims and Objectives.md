Aims:
1. Track TFR in Africa overtime and investigate how our chosen variables (Female Labour Force Participation Rate, the Human Development Index and Females' enrolment in Secondary Education) influence TFR and thus population growth's estimation in this continent in comparison to the rest of the world. 
2. Draw conclusions to better inform government policies regarding population growth goals.
