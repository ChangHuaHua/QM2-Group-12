Overall, we managed to successfully draw out meaningful relationships between Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in Africa and our chosen variables. From our analysis and data visualisations, we uncovered how more developed countries with a higher Human Development Index (HDI) tended to have lower TFR. Similarly, there was negative correlation between female secondary education and TFR, where as female education increased over the years, TFR decreased. Our conclusions regarding Female Labour Participation Rate (FLPR) was rather mixed with no significant correlation with TFR. Some African countries displayed positive correlations while others had negative correlations. Finally, the income variable showed a stronger relationship, whereby as national income rose, TFR fell. We felt investigating multiple variables was a good decision, because combined influences better explained TFR than a single variable. 

HDI, female education and income are all factors commonly linked to socioeconomic, therefore this leads us to believe that there is a definite correlation between development and TFR for countries in Africa. The more developed the country, the lower TFR, meaning less children are born which allows for more sustainable population growth.
