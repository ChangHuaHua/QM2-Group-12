**Why Total Fertility Rate ?**

It is hardly deniable that population growth is one of the greatest challenges of this century (NATO, 2011) with regards to resource allocation and more broadly sustainable development. 
Some have highlighted the relevance of focusing on population dynamics to grasp the scale of the current challenge with respect to sustainability (United Nations Population Fund, 2013). 
Population growth impacts many aspects of society such as employment, poverty, access to health, education, food and water consumption amongst others, making it hard for policy makers to ignore it. 
Others have emphasized the environmental challenge that population growth poses by commenting on the pressure humans are putting on food and water resources and on the increasing amount of Co2 emissions caused by humans’ activity  (Butler & Dovers, 2020). 
We can thus foresee several matters : less resources in food, water, energy, the multiplication of climate refugees etc. Accordingly, these changes might cause starvation problems, conflicts for the control of resources or even migration crisis. 
Considering the significance of these challenges for development, peace and prosperity, adjusting policies according to population growth projections could be a way to get closer to some form of sustainable development. 
Tracking down The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) which is the indicator evaluating the total number of children that would be born to each woman if she were to live to the end of her child-bearing years (between 15 and 49) (OECD Data, 2020), is a reliable way to estimate future population growth rates and thus anticipate, to some extent, the potential challenges it entails which would allow societies to better apprehend them (Britannica, 2020). The Total Fertility Rate is indeed a significant contributor to population growth. In fact, Total Fertilty Rate decreased from 5.5 children per woman to 2.3 children per woman at world scale in the past fifty years (World Fertlity Report, 2015) and at the same time, the world population growth rate has declined from 2.3% to 1.05% per year (Roser, Ritchie & Ortiz-Ospina, 2019). This correlation is also observable for the inverse tendency and more specifically for Africa. While the majority of countries have seen their fertility rates fall below the replacement level (2.1), level at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to another (Craig, 1994), the African continent has had still not reached the low fertility level since its Total Fertility Rate was worth 4.2 in 2018. This therefore explains its above world average population growth rate being equal to 2.7% each year in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

**Why Africa?**

Africa has been chosen as the region of focus as it has countries with some of highest fertility rates in the world. With many countries on the development spectrum and varying TFRs, this continent will provide fruitful insights. It is believed this continent will have a disproportional contribution to population increases in the coming years as it is thought that less developed nations will contribute to around 97% of global population increases from now till 2050 (Robey, Rutstein and Morris, 1993). 

**Why these variables?**

Our will to specifically focus on four background variables (Human Development Index (HDI), Female’s enrolment in secondary education and Female Labor Force Participation Rate and Income) is not only the consequence of a methodological decision but mainly the result of the meaning we are aiming to bring to this project in the light of development and women empowerment. 
Moreover, some of these variables have had not been investigated and studied with the approach we are willing to take in relation to TFR in Africa. 
Regarding the correlation between HDI and TFR, it has been examined generally and not in a precise location (Almasi-Hashiani, Sepidarkish & Omani-Samani, 2016), it has been studied jointly with unemployment in Romania (A.Cojocariu, 2015) and independently in Europe but not specifically in Africa. 
When looking at the correlation in itself, it is commonly assumed that HDI and TFR are negatively correlated although this relationship is actually more complex. 
Our investigation will enable us to determine the dominant trend on the African continent and to better understand this relationship. 
According to the different findings, Girls’ education is also negatively correlated with TFR (Pradhan, 2015): female education drives a decline in TFR.
Thus, understanding the negativity of this correlation and approving it throughout our analysis will allow us to appraise and emphasize on the various benefits of targeting female education through policies.  
The correlation between female labor participation rate and TFR has been tackled for different regions of the world such as the US (Japaridze, 2019), OECD countries in general (Mishra & Smyth, 2019) and for Uganda (Bbaale, 2014). 
As stated by these reports, a two way correlation has been observed: TFR has an impact on Female Labor Participation Rate and vice versa (Mishra & Smyth, 2019). Finally, according to Herwig Birg's demographic-economic paradox, it is more likely that the TFR declines when income is high and that TFR is significant when income is low.(2000) 
Our project will therefore investigate whether these latter corelations can be applied to the African continent.
